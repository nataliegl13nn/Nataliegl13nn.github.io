    <h1>CRAP Principles Analysis: AloYoga.com</h1>

    <h2>Contrast</h2>
    <p>Alo Yoga uses high contrast throughout its site to direct attention. Large product photos with white backgrounds paired with black text and bold CTA buttons, helping users easily distinguish what’s clickable. Color contrast between headings and body text enhances scannability while maintaining a sleek, minimal style.</p>

    <h2>Repetition</h2>
    <p>The site applies repetition through consistent font styles, button shapes, and layout structure across all product and content pages. This visual consistency reinforces the brand’s clean identity and makes navigation feel intuitive. Repetition is clear in the “Shop the Look” sections and the repeated use of white space and muted tones.</p>

    <h2>Alignment</h2>
    <p>All elements on the site are well aligned from navigation bars to product grids. Text is left aligned for readability, and product tiles are evenly spaced in a structured grid, helping guide the eye logically. Dropdown menus and headers align cleanly with the overall page design, giving the layout a polished look.</p>

    <h2>Proximity</h2>
    <p>Alo Yoga effectively groups related content together. Product descriptions are positioned directly beneath images, and related items are suggested below the product you’re viewing. This logical proximity helps reduce cognitive load and allows users to explore without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
