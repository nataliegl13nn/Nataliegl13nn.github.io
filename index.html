    <h1>CRAP Principles Analysis: AloYoga.com</h1>

    <h2>Contrast</h2>
    <p>Alo Yoga uses high contrast throughout its site to direct attention. Large product photos with white backgrounds paired with black text and bold CTA buttons, helps users easily distinguish what’s clickable. Color contrast between headings and body text enhances scannability while maintaining a sleek, minimal style.</p>
