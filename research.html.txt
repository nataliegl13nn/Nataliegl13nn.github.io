      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Roxanne Shanté's "Roxanne’s Revenge" wasn’t just a diss track — it was a cultural shift. Released in 1984, her fiery response to UTFO’s “Roxanne, Roxanne” helped launch the Roxanne Wars, flipped gender norms in hip-hop, and put a teenage girl at the center of rap’s most famous battle.</p>

      <h2>Rhetorical Power</h2>
      <p>Shanté’s delivery is a masterclass in rhetorical strategy. She mocks, challenges, and outsmarts her targets using tone, voice control, and sharp wordplay. Her authenticity and unapologetic tone gave her the ethos to stand out in a male-dominated space. Her use of everyday language also connected her to real listeners, making her message hit harder.</p>

      <h2>Production & Delivery</h2>
      <p>The track was recorded in one take over Marley Marl’s beat — itself a recycled UTFO instrumental. That raw, unpolished sound added to her credibility. There’s no fancy mixing or overproduction — just a girl and a mic, spitting truth. The unfiltered energy is part of what made it go viral in the streets.</p>
