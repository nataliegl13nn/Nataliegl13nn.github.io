      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <img src="IMG_1787.jpeg" alt="Natalie Glenn" class="about-photo">
      <p>I'm a graduate student currently studying web authoring and design. I have a strong interest in storytelling, hip-hop culture, and how digital tools can make academic content more accessible to everyday audiences.</p>

      <h2>Why I Chose This Topic</h2>
      <p>I chose to focus on “Roxanne’s Revenge” because it’s a moment in hip-hop history that changed the game. Roxanne Shanté’s voice, delivery, and confidence reshaped what it meant to battle in rap — especially as a young woman in a male-dominated space. Her story deserved a place online where more people could engage with it.</p>

      <h2>What I Learned in This Course</h2>
      <p>This course helped me understand the power of clean, responsive design. I learned how to structure web pages using HTML, style them with CSS, and make my content accessible for mobile users. More importantly, I learned how to translate complex ideas into a digital format that’s easy to read and interact with.</p>

      <h2>Transforming Academic Writing</h2>
      <p>Turning a research paper into a website wasn’t just about copying and pasting. I had to break up long paragraphs, simplify my language, and think about flow and visual hierarchy. This process taught me how to communicate better — not just as a writer, but as a digital creator.</p>
